# Additionally, Localization
After recieving a few comments about having the app available in different languages, and then having some amazing people help me with a couple languages I have opened the Eve Mining Timer Localization project up.

The goal is to get the app localized to a good many languages to share the help of this app.

Currently we have Translations for:
- English
- Spanish
- Croatian
